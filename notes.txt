the data have to fit in four big things :
collected and storable
measurable
analizable
visualized

Types of data :

Categorical or qualitative data :

Nominal Data: you can quantify them and there is no numerical value to it.
Ordinal Data: theres a certain order of differenciable values.

Numerical or Quantitative Data:

Discrete Data: something that is finite (costs, customers).
Continuous Data: something that is infinite (ages, time).

Statistics

Population vs sample

Population : The entire group that you want to study.

Sample : A specific group that will be used to 
collect Data (part of the population).

Sampling methods:

Probability sampling methods:
based on selecting random people

types:

simple random sample: you select random persons 
for example.

systematic sample: jumps on persons.

stratified sample: you want a clear representation 
of each population inside of your sample.

cluster sample: divides population in subgroups.

Non probability sampling methods:
you decide to who you ask

types:

convenience sample: You select people who you know.

Voluntary response sample: You ask to volunteers for 
taking your survey.

Purposive sample: you select people who for you 
fit to conduct the research.

Snowball sample: convinience sample but with a 
snowball effect.

Basic formulas:

Median: The middle number in a data select.

Mode: The number that appers the most in a data set.

Mean: The average of set of numbers that 
we are working with.

The basics of statistics part 4

Range:
The difference between the Max and the Min in a Data set.
It allows us to know what is the spread in the Data.
example: 2 3 4 5 6 12 | Max=12 - Min=2 = Range=10.

Quartiles:
A division of observations into Four defined intervals.

Standard Deviation:
The measure of the variation/dispertion of a Data set.

Variance:
The measure of the spread of a Data set.

The basics of statistics part 5 :

Decision Tree
Diagram or a chart that people use to show a statistical
probability or to determine the possibility for an action
to happen.
Where Decision Tree are used.

Information Gain
Give us how much information a certain variable give 
us about the outcome.
Interpretation: A high IG allow us to create a Decision tree,
that will be more representative of the results that we expect
to have.

The basics of statistics part 6 :

Probabilities :
The measure of likelihood that an event will occur in a
random Experiment.
Used in :
-Games of chance
-Weather prediction
-Finances
-Mathematics 
-Any type of prevision

types of events:
-Disjoint Event: if two events cannot both happen at the same time.
Example:The probability that we get one and two simultaneously by
rolling one dice.
-Non-Disjoint Events:The Two events can have a common outcome
Example:Rolling a pair of Dices and having identical numbers.

Type of Probabilities
-Marginal probability: The probability of an event occuring no
matter any other variable.
Example: The probability of drawing a black card in a deck of cards
-Conditional probability: the probability of an event ocurring
when another event has occurred.
Example:Drew a king in a deck of card and that the king is red.
-Joint Probability:Probability that two event occur at the
same time.
Example:Probability of you drew a 1 and a heart in a deck of cards

Probability distribution:
It's Function that describesthe likelihood of obtaining a possible
value that a random variable can assume based on different criteria.
Example:
-Normal distribution.
-Binominal distribution.
-Poisson distribution.
-Hyper geometric distribution.
-Many others.
